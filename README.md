# Code Challenge Repo: One Repo to Rule Them All!

## Student

Please follow the instructions. If your instructor's instructions differ from below, always listen to your instructor instead.

### Do This Once Before Your First Ever Challenge

Before your first code challenge, please Star this repo. This will trigger an invitation to join this repo as a collaborator. Once you get the email invitation, please accept the invitation. Please note that it may take a while for the invitation to arrive depending on how many invites are in the queue. If you do not see an invite by the next day, please ask your instructor for help. They can add you manually if needed - just give them your GitHub username.

If you lose your invitation, go to the following link while logged in to GitHub: https://github.com/learn-co-students/repo-name/invitations (replace <repo-name> with the actual repo name). 

Note that invitations expire after 7 days.

Your instructor will make this repo private once you have all been added.

### Instructions for Every Challenge

Before **every challenge**, clone down this repo using the `git clone` command and the Clone HTTPS link. This is important - we need you to have a clean repo to work from. _Do not use your old clones of this repo!_

`cd` into the directory of your current code challenge.

Create and checkout a new branch using your first and last name: `git checkout -b bartelby-cumberbuttons`

Push your branch: `git push origin bartelby-cumberbuttons`

Your instructor will confirm that your branch was pushed successfully. Once all branches appear, your instructor will ask you to start work on the challenge.

At the end of the challenge, make your final commit and push your branch! Await your grade brave almighty student!
